# Solidity Template â€” Your Smart Contract Starting Point

This project is sponsored by: XXXX XXXX XXXX, your name here. Contact [Will](https://twitter.com/fulldecent) for details.

If you are using these contracts, click at top to WATCH this repository for updates and security fixes, and click SPONSOR above to ensure updates and fixes keep coming.

## How to use this

1. Click USE THIS TEMPLATE above to make your own repository based on this template.

2. Install project and run all tests
   ```sh
   # Install Node 14+
   npm install
   npm test
   ```

3. Add your own application code inside the Contracts folder and tests inside the Tests folder.

4. Delete stuff you don't need.

5. Make sure tests still pass.

6. Deploy and make a GitHub release showing your deployed address.

## Introduction

This repository is a starting point for anybody developing their own Solidity smart contracts. It is opinionated. You should use this as your starting point for all your projects.

**Reusable utilities**

See the contracts/Utilities folder.

**Implementations**

See the contracts folder. In here are the contracts you would use to deploy your contract and other implementation-specific details.

## Run test suite

If you are on an M1 Mac, note that Node.js is currently broken.

Setup

```sh
nvm install 12 # see special instructions above for M1 Mac
nvm use 12
npm install
```

Now run this each time you change contracts or test scripts:

```sh
npm run prepare
npm run lint # note, we do not use Prettier style for Solidity
FORCE_COLOR=1 ENABLE_GAS_REPORT=true npm run test
npm run test:inheritance
npm run coverage
```

## Contributing

:moneybag: See our bug bounty at [BUG-BOUNTY.md](BUG-BOUNTY.md) (NOT YET ACTIVE).

This repository is supported by William Entriken. We are accepting contributions of new features to the repository but have not defined yet which new feaures are welcome (!).

Please send pull requests to improve documentation and test cases. Please send issues for anything that might be improved.

### Idioms

* The zero address (0x00...00) is no more special than the one address (0x00...01). If your application treats them differently, document it.
* Log things that people might reasonably want to look up or index.

  - Follow automated test cases and [Solidity style guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html), especially use [NatSpec](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html?highlight=natspec) everywhere
  - Use underbar prefix for and only for private variables/functions, see https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2798
- Use the contract name in every revert message
- Use a container for all work

### Style guide

- Use the Solidity style guide for Solidity code https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/
  - 120 hard limit line length
  - Function parameters start with an underscore (_)
  - NatSpec
    - Align whitespace for tags
    - Align whitespace for `@param`s
    - `@param` (and state variable `@dev`) are sentence case without capitalization for the first letter
    - Events
      - `@notice` sentence case in past-simple tense without a period like "Tokens were transferred"
    - Functions
      - `@notice` sentence case in present-simple tense without a period like "Finish a sale"
      - `@dev` sentence case with a period at end
    - State variables
      - `@notice` (same as `@return`)
  - Follow [Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/style-guide.html?highlight=style) where it makes sense
  - When comparing things, prefer to compare what we have versus the requirement, like `msg.sender == owner` rather than the reverse order.
  - Every require must have a message and start with the name of the contract/library
- Always use NatSpec with the `///` flavor (because Solidity documentation uses that one first, we can assume it is preferred). https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html
- Wrap Solidity to 120 columns
- Prefix private/internal functions & variables with underscore (_)
- File names and headings are sentence case. Except the name of this project is title case.
